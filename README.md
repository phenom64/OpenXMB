## About The Project

This project is a modern interpretation of the iconic XrossMediaBar (XMB) interface, famously used on the PlayStation 3 and other Sony devices. It is not a direct port, but a new implementation that leverages modern graphics APIs and C++ features to create a flexible and performant user interface for desktops and embedded systems.

The rendering backend is powered by **AuroreEngine** ([github.com/phenom64/AuroreEngine](https://github.com/phenom64/AuroreEngine)), a custom rendering library based on `dreamrender`. The entire application is built using C++23 modules for a clean and modern architecture.

## Features

*   **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with C++23 modules, CMake, Vulkan for rendering (with MoltenVK on macOS), and SDL2 for windowing and input.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Designed to run on SynOS (and other Ubuntu-based distros), macOS, and Windows.
*   **Dynamic XMB Interface:** A fully navigable, PS3-style cross-media bar with smooth animations and a dynamic wave background.
*   **Extensible Menus:** Includes menus for Settings, Photos, Music, Videos, Games, and Applications. The application menu automatically scans for `.desktop` files.
*   **Built-in Media Viewers:**
    *   Image viewer for common formats.
    *   Text viewer.
    *   FFmpeg-based video player with GPU-accelerated YUV decoding.
*   **Highly Configurable:** Runtime behavior, colors, fonts, and more can be configured via a simple `config.json` file.
*   **Optional Modules:** The build system allows enabling or disabling major features like the video player, a planned CEF-based web browser, and libretro core support.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:
*   Git
*   CMake (version 3.22 or newer)
*   A C++23 compatible compiler (Clang 16+, GCC 13+, MSVC 19.34+)
*   Ninja build system (recommended)

### Build Instructions

#### macOS

1.  **Install Dependencies (via Homebrew):**
    ```bash
    brew install cmake ninja pkg-config ffmpeg sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer gettext fmt freetype glm
    # Install the Vulkan SDK, which includes MoltenVK
    brew install vulkan-sdk
    ```

2.  **Build OpenXMB:**
    ```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/phenom64/OpenXMB.git
    cd OpenXMB

    # Configure the project
    cmake -B build -G Ninja

    # Build the project
    cmake --build build

    # (Optional) Install the application
    # This will place the binary and assets in the specified directory.
    cmake --install build --prefix "/Applications/OpenXMB"
    ```
    The launcher script will automatically try to locate the `MoltenVK_icd.json` file required for Vulkan to work on macOS.

#### SynOS / Ubuntu-based Distributions

1.  **Install Dependencies (via APT):**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install build-essential git cmake ninja-build pkg-config \
        libvulkan-dev vulkan-validationlayers-dev spirv-tools \
        libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev \
        libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libswresample-dev \
        libglm-dev libfreetype-dev gettext libfmt-dev
    ```

2.  **Build OpenXMB:**
    ```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/phenom64/OpenXMB.git
    cd OpenXMB

    # Configure the project
    cmake -B build -G Ninja

    # Build the project
    cmake --build build

    # (Optional) Install the application system-wide
    sudo cmake --install build
    ```

#### Windows

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   **Visual Studio 2022:** Install with the "Desktop development with C++" workload.
    *   **Git, CMake, Ninja:** Install these tools and ensure they are in your system's PATH.
    *   **Vulkan SDK:** Download and install from the [LunarG website](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/).
    *   **vcpkg:** Use vcpkg to install the remaining dependencies.
      ```powershell
      # Clone and set up vcpkg
      git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
      cd vcpkg
      ./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
      ./vcpkg integrate install

      # Install dependencies
      ./vcpkg install sdl2 sdl2-image sdl2-mixer ffmpeg freetype glm fmt gettext --triplet x64-windows
      ```

2.  **Build OpenXMB:**
    ```powershell
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/phenom64/OpenXMB.git
    cd OpenXMB

    # Configure the project, replacing [path to vcpkg] with your vcpkg directory
    cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path to vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

    # Build the project
    cmake --build build

    # (Optional) Install the application
    cmake --install build --prefix "C:/OpenXMB"
    ```

### Build Options

You can customize the build using the following CMake options:
*   `-DENABLE_VIDEO_PLAYER=ON/OFF`: Enable the FFmpeg-based video player (Default: ON)
*   `-DENABLE_BROWSER=ON/OFF`: Enable the CEF-based browser module (Default: OFF)
*   `-DENABLE_DISC_MEDIA=ON/OFF`: Enable DVD/Blu-ray support (Default: OFF)
*   `-DENABLE_LIBRETRO=ON/OFF`: Enable the libretro core host for emulation (Default: OFF)

Example: `cmake -B build -DENABLE_BROWSER=ON`

## Configuration

OpenXMB is configured using the `config.json` file. When you first run the application using the `XMS` launcher script, a default `config.json` will be created in your working directory. You can edit this file to change settings like:

*   Background colors and type (`wave`, `color`, `image`)
*   Fonts and date/time display
*   Controller settings
*   Render quality (VSync, MSAA, FPS limit)

The application looks for assets (icons, sounds, fonts) in a directory specified by the `XMB_ASSET_DIR` environment variable. If not set, it defaults to the `share/shell` directory relative to the executable.

## Roadmap

*   **âœ… M1: Scaffold:** App compiles & runs; static XMB; JSON config.
*   **ðŸš§ M2: Menus, Fonts, Icons:** Fully navigable XMB with text & icons.
*   ** M3: Audio & Music:** Background music playback, visualizer, and sound effects.
*   **ðŸš§ M4: Video Player:** File playback with software decoding is complete. Hardware acceleration and subtitles are next.
*   ** M5: Libretro Overlay:** Emulation support via a libretro core host.
*   ** M6: Web Browser:** Integration of a CEF-based browser.
*   ** M7: Disc Media:** Support for DVD/Blu-ray playback.
*   ** M8: Performance Pass:** Pipeline caching, optimized memory usage, and descriptor indexing review.
